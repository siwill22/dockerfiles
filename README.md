# dockerfiles
Files I used to make various docker containers

   - pygplates contains an ubuntu 14 machine with pygplates, various other related modules, and GMT 5.3.1
   - pygplates16 is apparently identical except for using ubuntu 16
   - stagpy contains stagpy (python 3.6, no pygplates)
   - GMT and GMT-are plain GMT machines building the latest GMT from svn source (these files appear to be duplication, should remove one)
